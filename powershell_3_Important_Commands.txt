3) Get-Member :-
 
Get-Member is a PowerShell cmdlet that gets the members, the properties and methods, of objects. You can use it to explore the structure and capabilities of different types of objects, such as strings, arrays, processes, services, etc. You can specify the object by using the InputObject parameter or piping an object to Get-Member. For example:

# Get the members of a string object
"Hello" | Get-Member

# Get the members of a process object
Get-Process -Name notepad | Get-Member

You can also use the MemberType parameter to filter the members by their type, such as Properties, Methods, Events, etc. For example:

# Get only the properties of a service object
Get-Service -Name wuauserv | Get-Member -MemberType Properties

To get information about static members, the members of the class, not of the instance, use the Static parameter. For example:

# Get the static members of the Math class
[Math] | Get-Member -Static
