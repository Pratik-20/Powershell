#Alias


An alias is an alternate name or "shorthand name" for a cmdlet or for a command element, such as a function, script, file, or executable file. You can run the command using the alias instead of the executable name.

#To get help and see syntax of alias use

PS C:\Users\PTHORAWA> Get-Help Get-Alias

#You can use the Get-Alias cmdlet to see all the aliases available in your session

PS C:\Users\PTHORAWA> get-alias

--------------------------------------------

#To see Services starting with "M"

PS C:\Users\PTHORAWA> Get-Service -Name M*


#To check your computer-name

PS C:\Users\PTHORAWA> hostname

#To see Services starting with "M" with the your computer-name

PS C:\Users\PTHORAWA> Get-Service -Name M* -ComputerName LIN-5XX0518XX

-------------------------------------------------------------

#Keep in mind don't use alias in scripting 

#You can use the Get-Alias cmdlet to see all the aliases available in your session

PS C:\Users\PTHORAWA> get-alias | more


# To see aliases associated with the "Service" command

PS C:\Users\PTHORAWA> get-alias -Definition *Service*

CommandType     Name
-----------     ----
Alias           gsv -> Get-Service
Alias           sasv -> Start-Service
Alias           spsv -> Stop-Service


Here "gsv"  is the shortest command which we can use instead of "Get-Service", same for the rest commands.


#Now, run above first command using Alias in it.

PS C:\Users\PTHORAWA> gsv -Name M*

Using above command we get same output as of we got for below command.

PS C:\Users\PTHORAWA> Get-Service -Name M*


#To see detailed info about "gsv" use help

PS C:\Users\PTHORAWA> help gsv
